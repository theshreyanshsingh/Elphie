| **License** | BSD 2-Clause (open source) | Proprietary | Proprietary |
| **Self-hostable** | ✅ Yes — one Docker command | ❌ SaaS only | ❌ SaaS only |
| **Pricing** | Free (self-host) · usage-based (cloud) | Per-minute SaaS | Per-minute SaaS |
| **Bring your own LLM / STT / TTS** | ✅ Any provider, or use Elphie's stack | Configurable within their integrations | Configurable within their integrations |
| **Source-level customization** | ✅ Every line is yours to modify | ❌ Closed source | ❌ Closed source |
| **Data residency** | Your infra, your rules | Their cloud | Their cloud |
| **Vendor lock-in** | None | Full | Full |


## 🚀 Get Started

##### Download and setup Elphie on your Local Machine

> **Note**
> We collect anonymous usage data to improve the product. You can opt out by setting `ENABLE_TELEMETRY=false` before running the startup script.

> **Note**
> If you wish to run the platform on a remote server instead, checkout our [Documentation](https://elphie.willowave.in/deployment/docker#option-2:-remote-server-deployment)

```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theshreyanshsingh/Elphie/main/docker-compose.yaml && curl -o start_docker.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theshreyanshsingh/Elphie/main/scripts/start_docker.sh && chmod +x start_docker.sh && ./start_docker.sh
```

> **⚡ Prefer an AI agent to set it up for you?**
> If you use **Claude Code** or **Codex**, install the official [Elphie setup skill](https://github.com/theshreyanshsingh/Elphie-plugins) and let your agent handle installation, configuration, and troubleshooting — it detects your OS, picks the right deploy path, runs Elphie's own setup scripts, and verifies the result.
>
> ```text
> # In Claude Code
> /plugin marketplace add theshreyanshsingh/Elphie-plugins
> /plugin install elphie@elphie
> ```
>
> Then start a new session and ask it to _"set up Elphie"_ (or run `/elphie-setup`). Codex is supported too — see the [plugin repo](https://github.com/theshreyanshsingh/Elphie-plugins#install).

> **Note**
> First startup may take 2-3 minutes to download all images. Once running, open http://localhost:3010 to create your first AI voice assistant!
> For common issues and solutions, see 🔧 **[Troubleshooting](docs/getting-started/troubleshooting.mdx)**.

### 🎙️ Your First Voice Bot

1. Open [http://localhost:3010](http://localhost:3010) in your browser.
2. Pick **Inbound** or **Outbound**, name your bot (e.g. _Lead Qualification_), and describe the use case in 5–10 words (e.g. _Screen insurance form submissions for purchase intent_).
3. Click **Test Agent**.
4. Use **Test Audio** to talk to your agent in the browser, or **Test Chat** to iterate faster in text. In Test Chat, you can edit or replay user turns and Elphie will regenerate the agent's replies and node transitions from that point.

> 🔑 **No API keys needed.** Elphie ships with auto-generated keys and its own LLM / TTS / STT stack. Connect your own keys for LLM, TTS, STT, or Telephony (e.g. Twilio, Vonage, Telnyx) anytime.

## Build Agents with MCP

Elphie ships with an MCP server, so coding agents can work directly inside your Elphie workspace.

Connect Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, or any MCP client to inspect existing agents, search Elphie docs, fetch node schemas, create new workflows, and save draft edits from natural language.

When asking your coding agent to build a voice agent, share a short script for
the use case instead of only a one-line prompt. Include the agent persona, call
flow, rules, objection handling, success criteria, and a sample conversation if
you have one.

See the [MCP guide](https://elphie.willowave.in/integrations/mcp) to connect your assistant.

## Features
